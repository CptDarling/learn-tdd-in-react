# Test Driven Development

This repository was created during the tutorial [Learn TDD in React](https://learntdd.in/react/).

It began with writing a Cyprus end to end test describing a user interaction with our app. Run Cypress with `npm run cypress`.

Jest tests for the component were written and ran with `npm run test`.
