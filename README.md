# Test Driven Development

This repository was created during the tutorial [Learn TDD in React](https://learntdd.in/react/).

It began with writing a Cyprus end to end test describing a user interaction with our app. Run Cypress with `npm run cypress`.

Jest tests for the component were written and ran with `npm run test`.

## Deploy to Vercel

It was very easy to deploy to the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

The production version of this tutorial is at [learn-tdd-in-react](https://learn-tdd-in-react-cptdarling.vercel.app/).
